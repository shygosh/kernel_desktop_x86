Linux kernel 6.13-rc1
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in several formats, such as  HTML and PDF. Please be sure to read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

To build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
Several of them use the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result from upgrading your kernel.

This release candidate software might have issues with your computer hardware. 
So please be careful not to compile this release candidate kernel using the wrong computer architecture.

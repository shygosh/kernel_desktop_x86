# Linux - Modified USB Driver

Forked from https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master.

For COSC439 final report, our team's goal is to To reverse engineer the 
Linux USB driver by identifying system calls, finding the 
implementation of these calls, and understanding how their implementation 
works. The driver will be modified to implement automatic encryption of 
files added to a USB flash drive and introduce user authentication for 
accessing the files.



Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

# Linux security

For the security of the de-facto center of open-source web, I propose to look it like the Rust ecosystem, starting from the history of Rust when it was built with
external tools, up until it's building from _Rust by Rust_, I also propose to make a _crates.io_-like website, where every Linux developer can seek for packages,
nevermind built in C, or Perl - (yes, that perl, that's still inside Git - __yes, it's me - straight to Linus__), and that everybody can make their version of
Linux, or Simux easier... Or put it on the web, on such website, making it more open source, more "more eyes on the code", and much more cheaper for big-tech to startup.

## To consider:

1. Open source crates.io -like website with packages to make own version of Your-Name-Here-__ux__.
2. Decouple of source code into the tiniest working bits, so that above point holds.
3. We are all getting older, so if we want to survive, we need to at least leave something for others to do, thus the Rust, and C in Rust must be minimized or,
to put it in other words C in Rust must be minimized and Rust in ..."UX" put to the test if it's better, faster, safer, and eventually discarded, made new Kernel
language, or coexist with other tools and still hold on point 1.
